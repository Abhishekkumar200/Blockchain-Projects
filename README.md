# A Cyber Secure Medical Management System by Using Blockchain
## Abstract
The pharmaceutical industry faces formidable challenges, notably the proliferation of counterfeit drugs and the complexity of vaccine supply chain management, necessitating innovative solutions. This project introduces Transparent, Immutable, and Secure Vaccine Supply Chain (TISVSchain), a blockchain-based framework designed to mitigate issues related to counterfeit vaccines and enhance transparency, immutability, and traceability in the supply chain. Recognizing the heightened difficulty in standardizing and detecting fake vaccines, especially with the surge in online pharmacies, the framework operates on public blockchains. TISVSchain's implementation on the public blockchain employs smart contracts with minimal gas costs, ensuring cost-effectiveness. The proposed framework emphasizes security enhancements through the use of offline unique account addresses and strives to optimize efficiency by minimizing gas costs, reducing lost blocks, and maintaining high transaction throughput. Evaluation experiments, involving variations in the number of nodes and block time, demonstrate promising results in terms of transaction speed, gas costs, and propagation delay. While addressing critical concerns in vaccine supply chain management, TISVSchain aims to foster trust, security, and efficiency, paving the way for improved pharmaceutical industry performance.
