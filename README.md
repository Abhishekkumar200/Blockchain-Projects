# A Cyber Secure Medical Management System by Using Blockchain
## Abstract
The pharmaceutical industry faces formidable challenges, notably the proliferation of counterfeit drugs and the complexity of vaccine supply chain management, necessitating innovative solutions. This project introduces Transparent, Immutable, and Secure Vaccine Supply Chain (TISVSchain), a blockchain-based framework designed to mitigate issues related to counterfeit vaccines and enhance transparency, immutability, and traceability in the supply chain. Recognizing the heightened difficulty in standardizing and detecting fake vaccines, especially with the surge in online pharmacies, the framework operates on public blockchains. TISVSchain's implementation on the public blockchain employs smart contracts with minimal gas costs, ensuring cost-effectiveness. The proposed framework emphasizes security enhancements through the use of offline unique account addresses and strives to optimize efficiency by minimizing gas costs, reducing lost blocks, and maintaining high transaction throughput. Evaluation experiments, involving variations in the number of nodes and block time, demonstrate promising results in terms of transaction speed, gas costs, and propagation delay. While addressing critical concerns in vaccine supply chain management, TISVSchain aims to foster trust, security, and efficiency, paving the way for improved pharmaceutical industry performance.
## Introduction
The vaccine supply chain management faces formidable challenges, encompassing issues such as transparency, vaccine record fraud, counterfeiting, and security concerns. These problems have profound implications for human health, given the potential fatal impact of fake vaccines. Record tampering and data opacity further hamper the efficiency of vaccine supply chains. While traditional government supervision methods have been employed, they fall short in addressing problems like vaccine expiration due to potential information tampering. In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, pharmaceutical companies concentrated on vaccine development, emphasizing the need for a secure end-to-end logistics system in vaccine supply chains.

Beyond vaccines, the global drug supply chain confronts similar issues, with poor-quality drugs causing thousands of deaths, and counterfeit drugs resulting in significant financial losses for pharmaceutical industries. Initiatives like the identification of medicinal products (IDMP) standards in the European Union aim to combat these issues, emphasizing the necessity of a well-maintained, immutable supply chain. The traditional drug supply chain involves a lengthy process from raw material sourcing to consumer distribution, presenting challenges such as lack of transparency, traceability, and immutability. Addressing these issues requires a comprehensive and secure supply chain approach on a global scale.

## Challenges
* ### Lack of Transparency:
  Despite significant investments, transparent drug supply chain management struggles to materialize, particularly in the pharmaceutical sector. The primary hurdle remains    the inadequate visibility of vaccine supply chains, impeding progress in the industry.
* ### Lack of Transparency:
  Traditional drug supply chains face challenges in predictive monitoring and traceability due to disparate stakeholder databases and manual record-keeping, causing delays.   Addressing this, implementing smart contracts and adopting a blockchain-based framework can enhance efficiency and resolve these issues in drug supply chain management.
* ### Trust Issue:
  Drug supply chain management involves numerous participants, complicating the process until the product reaches the consumer. Sustaining trust among these stakeholders      proves a major challenge, impacting the overall smoothness of the supply chain process.
* ### Cold-Chain Shipping:
  Maintaining the integrity of temperature-sensitive drugs, such as vaccines or blood, demands specialized care and equipment for refrigerated transport. However, not all     supply chain entities offer cold facilities. The pharmacy industry grapples with the challenge of producing and distributing vaccines, emphasizing the necessity for an      effective cold chain system in management.
* ### Fake Drugs:
  The infiltration of counterfeit drugs into the market is facilitated by the lack of transparency and outdated information-sharing mechanisms in the pharmaceutical supply    chain. These counterfeit products reach consumers, jeopardizing thousands of lives and impacting the economy adversely. Upgrading the supply chain system is imperative      to mitigate these risks and ensure public health and economic well-being.
* ### Single Point of Failure:
  The existing drug supply chain management relies on centralized, cloud-based systems for data storage. However, the vulnerability lies in the potential collapse of the      entire system if this centralized server is compromised. Additionally, users have limited control over their data, as it is entrusted to a third-party cloud provider,       raising concerns about data security and integrity in the supply chain management process.
* ### Unreliable Reputation Systems:
  Feedback and user comments play a pivotal role in assessing drug quality management. The centralization of systems, with third parties overseeing data storage, poses a      risk of tampering with user feedback, potentially concealing negative comments. To ensure an unalterable and transparent reputation system, blockchain technology becomes    essential, providing a secure and trustworthy platform for maintaining the integrity of user feedback in drug quality management.
* ### Unreliable Reputation Systems:
  Traditional drug supply chain management relies on cumbersome paperwork for transactions, ownership changes, and letters of credit, resulting in complexity and              obsolescence. This can be streamlined by implementing a smart contract system, automating transactions and recording them in an immutable manner, offering a more            efficient and contemporary solution to these challenges.
